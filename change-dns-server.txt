# Change system DNS server

# /etc/resolv.conf — file that tells the system which DNS servers to use for
# resolving hostnames. Edit as root (e.g. sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf).

# Nameserver options:
#   8.8.8.8   — Google Public DNS
#   1.1.1.1   — Cloudflare DNS

# Note: On many Linux systems, resolv.conf is managed by systemd-resolved,
# NetworkManager, or another service. Manual edits may be overwritten on reboot
# or when the network reconnects. To make changes persistent, configure DNS in
# your network manager (e.g. NetworkManager connection settings) or in
# systemd-resolved (e.g. /etc/systemd/resolved.conf).

# Steps
# -----
# 1. Open /etc/resolv.conf (e.g. sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf).
# 2. Change the nameserver line to one of:
#      nameserver 8.8.8.8
#      nameserver 1.1.1.1
#    (You can list multiple nameserver lines; the system uses them in order.)
